%% Repeat transect processing
% The processing of repeat-transect data typically consists of the
% following steps:
% 
% # <transect_data_selection.html Data selection> 
% # <transect_cross_section.html Determining placement and direction of
% cross-section>
% # <transect_bathymetry.html Building of a bathymetric model>
% # <transect_mesh_construction.html Construction of a mesh for data
% projection>
% # <transect_solving_data.html Solving the data on the mesh>
% # <transect_post_processing.html Post-processing and visualizing the data>
%
% ADCPTools can solve various types of data on the defined mesh, e.g.
% velocity data, backscatter data, and any other type of external data.
%
% Depending on the collected data the steps might be slightly different. A
% dataset collected in a tidal environment will include additional steps to
% account for significant water level variation during the data collected.
