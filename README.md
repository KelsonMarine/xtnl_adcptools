# adcptools


ADCPtools to process ADCP data. Features include:
- Basic processing of ADCP data, including coordinate transformations, backscatter calculation, easy plotting
- Repeat transect processing, including  Vermeulen et al. (2014) method to reduce homogeneity assumption and possibility to include tidal velocity models and taylor expanded velocity models
- Basic acoustic functions to compute scattering cross-section, specific attenuation, form-function, beam pattern, etc.
- Calibration of backscatter with water samples
